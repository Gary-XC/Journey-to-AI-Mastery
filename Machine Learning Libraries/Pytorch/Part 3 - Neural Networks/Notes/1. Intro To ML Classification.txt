Neural Network Classification with Pytorch

What is a Classification Problem:
- Is this email spam or not spam? --> Binary Classification(one thing or another, split into spam or not spam)
- Is this a photo of sushi, steak or pizza -->  Classification(more than one thing or another)
- What tags should this article have? -->  Multi-label Classification(more than one label per image or sample)

Binary vs Multi Classification:
Binary: Cats, dogs are the only animals that are included and that the model is being tested on
Multiclass: If chickens are also added to the cats and dogs Classification then it is a Multiclass Classification as there are more than 2 things to classify

What We Are Going To Cover:
- Architecture of a neural network classification model
- Input and Output shapes of a classification model (features and labels)
- Creating custom data to view, fit and predict on
- Steps in modeling:
    - Creating a model
    - Setting loss and optimizer function
    - Creating a training loop
    - Evaluating a model
- Saving and loading models
- Harnessing the power of non-linearity
- Different classification evaluation methods
