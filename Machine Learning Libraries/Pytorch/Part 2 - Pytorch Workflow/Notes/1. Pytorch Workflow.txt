Pytorch Workflow:
1. Getting the data ready to turn into tensors

2. Building or picking a pretrained model that suits the problem
    2.1 Pick a loss function and optimizer
    2.2 Build a training loop

3. Fit the model to the data and make a prediction

4. Evaluate the model

5. Improve the model through experimentation

6. Save and reload your model - to make predictions on other datasets and problems'
