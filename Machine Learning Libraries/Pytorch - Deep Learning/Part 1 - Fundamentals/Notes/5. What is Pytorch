What is Pytorch?
- most popular deep learning framework
- able to write fast deep learning code in python
- able to run one or multiple GPU's
- has access to many pre-built deep learning models
    - torchhub
    - torchvision.models
- is full stack, meaning that pytorch can do everything in the deep learning pipeline
    - preprocess the data
    - model the data
    - and deploy your models
- designed by meta, is now opensource and used by tesla, microsoft, and openai

To check if pytorch and other libraries use cases in programs: https://paperswithcode.com/trends
- pytorch is a scientific favourite

Why use/learn Pytorch:
Is used by a significant amount of influential companies:
- tesla: computer vision
- openai: standardizing in Pytorch --> ai research
- meta/facebook: is building the future on Pytorch
- microsoft
- the increadible pytorch --> includes all of the projects that have built on top of pytorch
- is used in agriculture

Pytorch helps you by running your code accelerated on a GPU:
- is very fast at calculating numbers
- uses CUDA a parallel computing platform, that allows softare to use specific types of GPU for general purpose processing rather than just for gaming
