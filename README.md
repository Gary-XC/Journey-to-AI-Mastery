# Journey-to-Pytorch-Mastery
The documentation of the struggles and challenges of an aspiring AI developer's journey to master a key library for deep learning. And to eventually understand deep neural networks, and eventually use that knowledge to implement deep learning and machine learning for my projects and products


Timeline:
1. Pytorch Video

3. Project 1 - Utilizing torch-vision - for scanning and picking out the important information from a document based on keywords given by the user
- eg; dates, names, certain phrases, and topics
- uses for this: studying using it to scan through an entire 

5. Project 2 -
