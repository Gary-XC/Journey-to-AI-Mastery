# Journey to AI Mastery
The documentation of the struggles and challenges of an aspiring AI developer's journey to master essential libraries for AI and deep/machine learning. To harness the knowledge acquired for developing and implementing deep learning and machine learning projects, both personally and professionally.

## Data Science Projects from Scratch --> [Step by Step Example](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t)
Playlist goes over all the steps in creating a project from scratch:
- Brainstorming and picking a project from topics and questions you have and are interested in
- Goes over finding and scraping the data from online
- Also goes over all the trial and error that was encountered while completing the project

#### Project 1 (Computer Vision and )
Utilizing torch-vision - for scanning and picking out the important information from a document based on keywords given by the user
- eg; dates, names, certain phrases, and topics
- uses for this: studying using it to scan through an entire document or notebook

#### Project 2 (Web scraping and recommender system)
Classifier --> for finding news articles based on the news that you have selected/given, and the program updates in the morning for the latest news
- will summarize the more important and longer articles, based on the user's preference 
- allows you to categorize the subjects however the user wants; eg: if you want to keep track of events that are currently occurring in the world, then you don't have to be interrupted by which sports team won the game last night
- eg; if you are interested in specific sports teams and leagues
