# Journey-to-AI-Mastery
The documentation of the struggles and challenges of an aspiring AI developer's journey to master essential libraries for AI and deep/machine learning. To harness the knowledge acquired for developing and implementing deep learning and machine learning projects, both personally and professionally.  

Timeline:
## Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Project 1 - Utilizing torch-vision - for scanning and picking out the important information from a document based on keywords given by the user
- eg; dates, names, certain phrases, and topics
- uses for this: studying using it to scan through an entire document or notebook

Project 2 - Classifier --> for finding news articles based on the news that you have selected/gave, and you
