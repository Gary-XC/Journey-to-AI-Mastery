# Journey-to-AI-Mastery
The documentation of the struggles and challenges of an aspiring AI developer's journey to master key libraries for AI machine/deep learning. And to eventually understand deep neural networks and use that knowledge to implement deep learning and machine learning for my projects and products.


Timeline:
1. Pytorch Video

With 4 Videos a day(each video is about 10 minutes, so around 40 minutes a day) we can finish the video in about 40 days

2. Complete Mathematics behind Neural Networks and Deep Learning Video

3. Project 1 - Utilizing torch-vision - for scanning and picking out the important information from a document based on keywords given by the user
- eg; dates, names, certain phrases, and topics
- uses for this: studying using it to scan through an entire document or notebook
