Different Types of Learning:
Supervised Learning
- labeled data, inputs, and examples of what the inputs and outputs look like
- eg. for pictures of cats and dogs, you know which pictures are which, in order for the algorithm to learn from its mistakes and what it got correct

Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning 
- dont have labeled data, so instead you rely on the algorithm to come to its own conclusions
- figure out the difference in patterns bewteen images of cats and dogs, but the algorithm itself wouldn't know the difference between them
- for self-supervised learning you can ask the algorithm for the patterns that it has learned, and you can give it names and catagorize the patterns
- Unsupervised and Self-Supervised learns only from the data that has been provided

Transfer Learning
- Deep learning
- Taking the patterns that one model has learned and transfers it to another model
- The new model then can get a headstart in the learning process
- We can transfer the patterns from the supervised cat and dog model to our own model which will then have a headstart
- is very powerful
