How should I approach this course?
1. Code along, writing a lot of pytorch code --> if ever in doubt run the code to see how it works

2. Explore and experiment --> approach this with the mindset of science and art

3. Visualize what you don't understand --> deep learning uses a lot of numbers, which can sometimes be hard to understand, so if there is a graph for a 
page worth of data it can be easier to understand

4. Ask questions --> even when you think that it is a dumb questions

5. Exercises --> do the exercieses for each section of the course, and a chance to practice what you have learning

6. Share your work... (Done lol)
