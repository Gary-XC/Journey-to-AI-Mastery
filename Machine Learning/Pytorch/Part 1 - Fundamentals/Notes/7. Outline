What are we going to cover in Pytorch?
Resources:
- Pytorch offical website
- Articles: https://www.learnpytorch.io/

In Part 1:
- Pytorch basics and fundementals
    - using and dealing with tensors and the operations that come with tensors

In later Parts:
- preprocessing data --> getting it ready for tensors to be able to manipulate
- building and using pretrained deep learning models
- fitting a model to the data --> in order for the model to find patterns from the data
- making predictions with the model --> using the patterns that were found and making predictions on new data 
- evaluating model predictions --> testing how well that data does(libraries that can calculate this for you, such as sklearn)
- saving and loading models, so everytime you want to rerun the code, you don't have the retrain the model
- using a trained model to make predictions on custum data


Pytorch Workflow
1. Get the data ready to turn into tensors
2. Build or pick a pretrained model(that will fit your problem)
    - pick a loss function and an optimizer
    - build a training loop for higher accuracy for the data
3. Fit the model to the data that you want to test on and make predictions
4. Evaluate the model
5. Improve the model through experimentation
6. Save and reload the trained model
