What is a Tensor?
A tensor is a list of numbers that is transformed from the media of inputs of the neural network such as images, audio so that the neural network can understand them
Then there are mathematical operations perfermed on those tensors 
Tensors are then outputed from the neural network, before they are converted back into medium that humans can understand
