Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks With Pytorch:
    - Model learns by itself from different patterns in the images that it trains on

Uses:
- Object detection (segmentation - the different sections oin the image: people, skin, hair, sky)
- Classification

Tesla Computer Vision:
- 8 cameras -> neural network -> 3d vector space

Topics Covered:
- vision data set to work with torchvision.datasets
- architecture of a convolution neural network (CNN) in Pytorch
- end to end multiclass image classification problem
- steps in modelling with CNNs in Pytorch:
    - Creating a CNN in Pytorch
    - picking loss and optimizer
    - training a modelling
    - evaluating a model
