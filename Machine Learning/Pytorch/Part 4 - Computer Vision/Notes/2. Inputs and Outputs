Computer Vision Inputs and Outputs:
1. Start with an image with a height and width (colour channel of 3: RGB)
2. Encode the images to tensors (normalized pixel values - or Numerical Encoding)
3. Machine Learning Algorithm
4. Predicted output (tensors, prediction probability for each class of the classification model)
5. Actual Outputs (could offer additional information about the output label or show more images of the predicted item)

Input Output Shapes:
- Making sure that the tensor output and input shapes line up with each other
- Make sure the the output shape fits the specific problem
