Architecture of a Classification Model:

Hyper-parameters:
- Input Layer Shape (inFeatures)
- Hidden Layers
- Output Layer Shape (outFeatures)
- Hidden Layer Activation
- Loss Function
- Optimizer

Binary Classification:
Need to convert things like male or female to 0 or 1 --> since tensors are only made up of numbers

Multiclass Classification:
- is similar to binary classification, but there will be more labels to encode to numbers
- for example with three output predictions there will have to be 3 different numbers that represent each class
