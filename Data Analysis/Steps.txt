Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, whether internal databases, external APIs, or public datasets. Ensure the data is representative of the questions or problems you want to address.

Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors within your dataset. This often involves correcting or removing bad data points to ensure more accurate results in later steps.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize the main characteristics of the data through numerical measures and visualizations. EDA helps uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and form initial hypotheses for deeper analysis.

Data Transformation / Feature Engineering: Create or modify features (variables) to better capture the relationships within the data. Techniques might include normalizing values, encoding categorical features, or combining multiple data points into a single variable.

Modeling / Analysis: Apply statistical or machine learning models to the processed data. This stage tests your hypotheses, discovers insights, and/or predicts outcomes based on the patterns found.

Evaluation and Validation: Assess how well your chosen model or analytical approach performs using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. This step ensures the robustness and generalizability of your findings.

Reporting and Communication: Present results in a clear and understandable format, using visualizations and concise explanations. Highlight key findings, insights, and any recommendations derived from the analysis.
